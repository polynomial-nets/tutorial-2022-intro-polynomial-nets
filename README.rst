======
Pi-nets
======

This code implements a polynomial network for image recognition. Specifically, it implements a product of polynomials (each polynomial has an NCP-based second degree polynomial). 


Train the network
=================

To train the network, you can execute the following command::

   python train_main.py



Apart from PyTorch, the code depends on Pyaml [2]_.
